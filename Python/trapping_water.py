# DESCRIPTION:
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

# EXAMPLE:
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] -> 6

# INPUT: 
# An array of the elevations

# OUTPUT: 
# A integer of the area that traps water

elevation = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

print()

# METHOD 1 - - - - -
print('METHOD 1')

# LOGIC:
